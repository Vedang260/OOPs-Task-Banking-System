# 🏦 OOP-Based Banking System in TypeScript

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Banking System** implemented in **TypeScript** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**. It demonstrates key OOP concepts such as **Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Polymorphism**, along with **interfaces, access modifiers, and static variables**.

## ✨ Features
✅ **Encapsulation** – Secure account details with private variables  
✅ **Abstraction** – Define a common interface for bank operations  
✅ **Inheritance** – Extend `BankAccount` to create `SavingsAccount` & `CurrentAccount`  
✅ **Polymorphism** – Override methods to provide specialized behavior  
✅ **Interfaces** – Ensure a consistent structure for all account types  
✅ **Static Variables** – Maintain common properties like bank name and interest rates  
✅ **Access Modifiers** – Use `private`, `protected` (via closures), and `public` members  

## 💻 Technologies Used
- TypeScript 
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
